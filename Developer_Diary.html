                    <p>I guess this will be my initial post onto the devleopment of this website. My main goal with this site is to have a central career hub. I'm hoping to use it as both a point of contact with companies as well as a place to store any projects I work on (I'll store the actual files on github, but have my thoughts in regards to each project on here). <br>I also want to use this space to improve my web development skills. I definitely have a grasp on how to create a webstie, however I am going to use this space to explore and develop my skills. There are some really cool Jquery plugins I want to work with, as well as some pasic html things (canvas) that I want to explore.</p>

                    <p>Originally, I was planning on using this space to practice and improve my web development skills. It has now become the basis for my website. As such, I am going to merge this and my website git into one git.<br> Today, I have been working on the résumé portion of the website. I wanted to split up the topics of the resume into their own sections, but I am not sure how I feel about the boxes currently </p>

Although there is definitely more for me to do on the website, I think that it is good enough to show. At least I'll be able to get something on the web.</p>

                    <p>I've spent the better part of a week working to set up an SFTP to the UMich file hosting website... I originally wrote a python script to push all the files, but I was having an issue due to the password that was required to connect to a server. I ended up just using a SFTP plugin on Sublime to set up the SFTP to the server. It was easier than I expected. </p>
                    <p> I have also been working on improving some basic things on the website. The first thing I fixed was the mail link. Originally it was just my email that I had when one looked at the contact page. Now, when someone clicks on the email it will automatically set up a mailto link. This was pretty easy to do, I just set the href to "mailto:example@email.com"

                    <p>I had a rather long subway trip to brooklyn on Sunday. Instead of reading, I decided to work on the general layout of the site in a sketch book. </p>
                    <p>One of the major changes I want to implement is updating the navigation bar. It's boring, and it doesnt look good. I am going to make it more interactive, and make their be weight behind the pushing of buttons. </p>
                    <p>I am also going to start converting all of my styling to SASS. I know how to use it, I have just been lazy and not using it - even though it will make my life a lot easier in the long run. I'm hoping to have that implemented by the end of the week.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I am going to be implementing my JS plugins to the website. This should help make the website more interactive, and I am looking forward to seeing what I can do with it. </p>

                    <p>I finally got around to convering my css page to scss. I probably could have just stayed using css, but scss makes so many things easier. Now that I have that done I am going to start working on other things for the site! One of the first things I am going to change is the color scheme. Although the black and white looks classy (in my opinion), it doesn't add anything personal to the site. I am planning on using a light brown and purple as accent colors, purely because they are my favorite colors. I will keep the majority of my site as black and white though. Happy I converted things to SASS though. </p>

                    <p> Two websites whose email list I subscribe to (and look forward to) are <a href = "http://www.medium.com">medium</a> and <a href = "https://techcrunch.com/">tech crunch</a>. They are where I receive the majority of my news and daily readings from. Recently, I read a post on medium.com that I really liked, and I wanted to talk about how it has affected how I am going to approach the design of this website.  </p>
                    <p> The <a href = "https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-striving-for-perfection-might-be-holding-you-back-as-a-newbie-web-developer-6e8ae257751f">post</a> I am talking about talks about how new web developers approach learning. I personally have fallen into the issue of trying to perfect every part of the website. As a result, I haven't been progressing as much as I'd like to. From here on out I am not going to try and be as much of a perfectionist on my website, rather I'd like to add everything to my website before I start perfecting things.</p>
